Timy
====

Timy is an Android app that let's you save the time you've worked on a project to your Google Calendar. For any consultant, especially those that have several clients and multiple projects for each one of those client Timy + Google Calendar will remind you how many hours you worked on every one of those projects.

It's simple.

1. Click on a project in Timy
2. Select number of hours and minutes you worked on that project today
3. Done!

Everything is now saved to your Google Calendar.

Having trouble remembering to time report? Set an alarm and Timy will notify you; perhaps every day at 18:00?
